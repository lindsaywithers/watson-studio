# Watson Studio: Hands-on
Get your hands dirty with machine learning in Watson Studio!

Watson Studio provides you with the environment and tools to solve your business problems by collaboratively working with data. You can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, to cleanse and shape data, to ingest streaming data, or to create, train, and deploy machine learning models.

This illustration shows how the architecture of Watson Studio is centered around the project. A project is where you organize your resources and work with data.

# Machine learning & AI in Watson Studio

IBM Watson Studio is a collaborative environment with AI tools that you and your team can use to collect and prepare training data, and to design, train, and deploy machine learning models.

Ranging from graphical tools you can use to build a model in minutes, to tools that automate running thousands of experiment training runs and hyperparameter optimization, Watson Studio AI tools support popular frameworks, including: TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, and Keras.

You can think of Watson Studio AI tools in three categories:

    Machine learning
    Deep learning
    Visual recognition
    
These tutorials will be centered around the Machine Learning category & the tools for designing, training and managing models:
* Model builder guides you, step by step, through building a model that uses Spark ML algorithms.
* Flow editor presents a graphical view of your model while you build it by combining nodes representing objects or actions (including SPSS Modeler nodes, Spark ML algorithm nodes, and neural network nodes.)
* Notebooks provide a collaborative environment for working with data, and rapid prototyping and testing of models.
